## Three Key Skills

In every project you undertake in your software development career, there are three key skills you will always depend upon.

1. [Know Your **Problem**](./ProblemSolving.md)
1. [Know Your **Language**](./LanguageRef.md)
1. [Know Your **Tools**](./ToolTips.md)

## Coding Tips

- When following a tutorial or looking at reference documentation, **read it carefully** (don't skim)
