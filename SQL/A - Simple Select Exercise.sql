-- Simple Select, without any other clauses
SELECT  'Dan', 'Gilleland'

-- Simple Select with expressions
SELECT  'Dan' + ' ' + 'Gilleland', 18 * 52, '5' + '10'
--        textual information      numbers    textual

-- Specify a column name with some hard-code/calculated values
SELECT  'Dan' + ' ' + 'Gilleland' AS 'Instructor',
        22 * 52 AS 'Weeks at the job'

-- Let's use the SELECT statement with database tables

-- 1.   Select all the information from the Club table
-- The SELECT statement produces a table of results which will consist of one or more rows of data.
SELECT  ClubId, ClubName
FROM    Club

-- The * can be used to indicate all of the columns. But DO NOT DO THIS, or your instructor
-- WILL deduct marks EVERY TIME you do this.
SELECT  *
FROM    Club

-- Notice that when selecting from an existing table, when we identify which columns we want to
-- show, then those column names are used as the column title for the results table.
-- The AS keyword  in the SELECT clause is used to assign a title to the column in the results table
SELECT  ClubId AS 'ID', ClubName
FROM    Club

-- These keyboard shortcuts are for SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
  -- Pro-Tip: Press [ctrl] + r to toggle the results window
  -- Pro-Tip: If you write the FROM clause before specifying the columns,
  --            you will get Intellisense help on the column names
  -- Pro-Tip: Press [ctrl] + [shift] + r to "refresh" intellisense

-- 2.   Select the FirstNames and LastNames of all the students
SELECT  FirstName, LastName
FROM    Student

-- 2.b. Select the student id and full name of all the students
SELECT  StudentID, FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Full Name'

-- 2.c. Select the first and last names of all the students,
--      and sort the results by the last name
SELECT    FirstName, LastName
FROM      Student
ORDER BY  LastName -- default is to sort in ASCENDING order
-- 2.d
SELECT    FirstName, LastName
FROM      Student
ORDER BY  LastName DESC -- Descending order
-- 2.e. Select the first and last names of all the students,

WHERE   C.CourseHours < 96

SELECT  ST.LastName, ST.DateHired, ST.DateReleased
FROM    Staff AS ST -- The use of the AS keyword in producing table/column aliases is optional
                    -- but it can be a good idea for readability.
-- You can use the full table name to fully-qualify your column names
SELECT  Staff.LastName, Staff.FirstName, Staff.DateHired
FROM    Staff
WHERE   Staff.DateReleased IS NOT NULL
-- NOTE: You can't mix the use of a table alias with the full name of the table

WHERE   R.Mark BETWEEN 70 AND 80
  AND   (R.CourseId = 'DMIT223' OR R.CourseId = 'DMIT168')
  --    I use parenthesis to force the OR operation to happen first
-- alternate answer to #8
SELECT  R.StudentID, R.CourseId, R.Mark
FROM    Registration AS R -- Alias for the Registration table
WHERE   R.Mark BETWEEN 70 AND 80
  AND   R.CourseId IN ('DMIT223', 'DMIT168') -- The IN keyword allows us to have a list of values
