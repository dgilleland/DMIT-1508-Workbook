--6. Create a stored procedure called "Provinces" to list all the students provinces.

--7. OK, question 6 was ridiculously simple and serves no purpose. Lets remove that stored procedure from the database.

--8. Create a stored procedure called StudentPaymentTypes that lists all the student names and their payment types. Ensure all the student names are listed, including those who have not yet made a payment.

--9. Modify the procedure from question 8 to return only the student names that have made payments.
