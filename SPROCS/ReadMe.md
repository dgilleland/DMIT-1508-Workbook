# Stored Procedures (*SPROCS*)

The demo and practice problems in this folder walk through the creation and use of **Stored Procedures** and are based on the database A0X-School. You can create the database with data by running the [install script](../SQL/A0X-School.sql). The complete ERD for this database is found at the [end of this document](#erd-for-A0X-School).

> A good reference for the grammar of [Stored Procedures](https://dmarshnait.github.io/dmit1508/storedprocedures) can be found on [Dana Marsh's site](https://dmarshnait.github.io/dmit1508/).

The comments below on the supplied script files highlight notable points on the problem statements and their relation to generating SQL solutions.
