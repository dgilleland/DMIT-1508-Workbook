-- > >= < <=
-- =    <>
-- Logical Operators
-- AND   OR    NOT
-- LIKE is used for pattern-matching
-- [A-Z] single character from A-Z inclusive
CHECK (Province LIKE '[A-Z][A-Z]')
-- [0-9] single character from 0-9 inclusive
-- BETWEEN - upper and lower bounds, inclusive
CHECK (Mark BETWEEN 0 AND 100)

-- Constraint Name Prefixes
-- PK  - Primary Key  - always clustered indexes
-- FK  - Foreign Key
-- DF  - Default
-- CK  - Check
-- UX  - Unique (Alternate Keys - AK) - always non-clustered indexes

-- Indexes
-- IX  - prefix for indexes
-- Indexes are a means of quickly referencing data by having the data sorted by the index.
-- Clustered Index refers to storing the Primary Key index column alongside the rest of the column data for the row.
-- Non-Clustered Index refers to storing an index alongside the corresponding PK index
