USE [A0X-School]
GO

--1. Select All position descriptions and the staff ID's that are in those positions
SELECT  PositionDescription, StaffID
FROM    Position AS P -- Start with the Position table, because I want ALL position descriptions...
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Staff AS S ON P.PositionID = S.PositionID

--2. Select the Position Description and the count of how many staff are in those positions. Return the count for ALL positions.
--HINT: Count can use either count(*) which means the entire "row", or "all the columns".
--      Which gives the correct result in this question?
SELECT  PositionDescription,
        COUNT(StaffID) AS 'Number of Staff'
FROM    Position AS P
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Staff AS S ON P.PositionID = S.PositionID
GROUP BY P.PositionDescription
-- but -- The following version gives the WRONG results, so just DON'T USE *  !
SELECT PositionDescription, 
       Count(*) -- this is counting the WHOLE row (not just the Staff info)
FROM   Position AS P
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Staff AS S
        ON P.PositionID = S.PositionID
GROUP BY P.PositionDescription
